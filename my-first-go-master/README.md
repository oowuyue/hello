# my-first-go
This project contains implementation for BFS and DFS algorithms, and data structures such as Stack, Queue and Graph. It can be run using command line arguments.

## Example
> ./data-structures 6 6 0 1 0 2 1 3 3 4 3 5 2 5 2

here first two arguments are number of vertices and edges for the graph.
next #edges are pair of edges (u, v).
after that one of two operation can be specified.

1. BFS
2. DFS
